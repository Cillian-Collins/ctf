In this post I'll walk you through how I solved the Pop-Up Bank challenge at the Digital Overdose CTF 2022. In the end, this challenge was only solved by 4 teams.

## Initial Assessment
```
Hey, this bank forgot to do a pentest? Wanna... do an ethical?
```

The challenge description hinted towards this being a "pentest" challenge. Without any source, and very little to go on, I used the `big.txt` wordlist from [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) combined with [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) to enumerate content.

It seems that /api/ and /oauth/ endpoints exist. I further fuzzed these, which revealed some more interesting paths:

## Understanding The Problem
Reading the `/api/docs` endpoint revealed all the information we needed to interact with the API. `/api/verify` and `/api/account` endpoints appeared to exist behind authentication. POSTing to these endpoints with an access_token would return `{"logged_in": false}` which shows that we were not authenticated!

It's clear we will need to takeover a user's account. The login endpoint accepts an email and password combination. From reading the `/team` page, we can see a list of emails. It would make sense to use this information to takeover a specific user's account. Scrolling down, we can see "Reina Turner" listed as administrator. It seems likely that he is the intended target.

The team page pulls this information from the `main.js` file. Reading this source, we can see the object includes the user emails. We now have Reina's email address!

`{"first_name":"Reina","last_name":"Turner","emails":"Reina.Turner@fakebank.com","img":"person9","role":"Administrator"}`

## Exploiting Authentication
Reading further along the `main.js` file, we can see a number of functions which are designed to be used from the admin dashboard. I searched for the endpoints I knew about (`/oauth` and `/api`). 

This is where I found the following code:

```js
return e.next = 2, new Promise((function(e, t) {
	c().post("/api/account", {
		access_token: n
	}).then((function(t) {
		return e(t)
	}))
}));
```                                                                             

We can see that it's posting to the API endpoint with an access token, the value of which is a variable called `n`. Where does this come from?

```js
var n = localStorage.getItem("token");
```

Just a few lines above, we can see it is loaded from local storage. So, I figured if it's loading from localStorage using javascript, it'll have to save to localStorage using javascript somewhere else in the file. Searching for `localStorage.setItem` I found the following:

```js
r = p(t).then((function(e) {
	return e
})), localStorage.setItem("token", r), e.next = 9;
```

So it loads the value of p(t). What is `p()` and what is `t`?

```js
return e.next = 2, c().post("/oauth/login", {
	email: t,
	password: n
});
```

Just a few lines above that, we see `t` is being used as the value for the email address of a user.

```js
p = function(e) {
                    var t = new Date,
                        n = Math.floor(t.getTime() / 1e3),
                        r = e + Number.toString(n),
                        o = (new TextEncoder).encode(r);
                    return crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", o).then((function(e) {
                        return Array.from(new Uint8Array(e)).map((function(e) {
                            return e.toString(16).padStart(2, "0")
                        })).join("")
                    }))
                };
```

And then we see that the function `p()` is loading the timestamp of login, concatenating it onto the email (`e`) and then running it through the SHA-256 hashing algorithm (along with some padding and other stuff). This is great, but what time do we use for the timestamp?

Well, this is where reconnaissance comes in. Earlier I discovered the endpoint `/api/status` which conveniently stored the timestamp of the last admin login.

`{"last_build_time":1656930000,"last_admin_access_time":1656931175}`

Armed with this, I could add that value to the end of the email, and then run it through the SHA-256 method described in the above `p()` function.
